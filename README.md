## 🚀 What is at the core of DungeonNoDragon ?

DungeonNoDragon is a **complete ecosystem** where modern web technologies meet **low-level game programming**:

* ⚡ Real-time multiplayer dungeon crawler
* 🌐 Full-stack TypeScript architecture
* 🎮 C++ game engine running in the browser (WebAssembly)
* 💬 Advanced chat & social system
* 🐳 Fully containerized with Docker

We wanted a combination of both **software engineering rigor** and **system-level understanding**, making it relevant for backend, full-stack, or systems-oriented roles.

## 🧱 Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Running a C++ game inside the browser

**Challenge:**
Bridging C++ (native) with JavaScript (web environment)

**Solution:**

* Compiled the game using **Emscripten → WebAssembly**
* Built custom bindings between JS and C++
* Managed memory across environments

---

### 2. Real-time multiplayer synchronization

**Challenge:**
Keeping all players in sync with minimal latency

**Solution:**

* Tick-based server architecture (~50ms) to keep the server responsive and predictable
* Server‑side authority and reconciliation mechanisms
* Client prediction + smoothing

---

### 3. Full-stack real-time architecture

**Challenge:**
Synchronizing frontend, backend, and game server

**Solution:**

* WebSockets (Socket.io + uWebSockets)
* Event-driven architecture
* Clear separation of responsibilities

---

### 4. Complex database design

**Challenge:**
Handling social features (chat, friends, permissions)

**Solution:**

* Fully normalized PostgreSQL schema
* Prisma ORM for maintainability and security
* Early design + iterative improvements

---

### 5. Team collaboration (5 developers)

**Challenge:**
Working on a large-scale project with tight deadlines

**Solution:**

* Agile-like organization
* Task distribution by domain
* Git workflow with protections
* Notion + Discord for communication
