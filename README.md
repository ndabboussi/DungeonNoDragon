## Technical Stack

### Frontend

* Language: TypeScript (ESNext) & JSX
* Bundler: Vite (Rollup)
* Framework: React
* Styling framework: Bulma
* Data fetching:
	* TanStack Query
	* Axios
* WebSocket: Socket.io

### Backend / API

* API type: REST
* Language: TypeScript (ESNext)
* Runtime: Node.js
* Framework: Fastify
* Type provider: TypeBox
* Hashing: Argon2
* WebSocket: Socket.io
* Documentation: Swagger

### Database

* System: PostgreSQL
* ORM: Prisma

### Game

**Client**
* Language: C++
* Library: SDL2
* Compiler: Emscripten
* Runtime: WebAssembly
* WebSocket: JavaScript

**Server**
* Language: C++
* WebSocket: uWebSockets
* HTTP Client: libcurl

<br>

**Technical Choices Justification**

>**⮕ Backend:** We chose TypeScript for its popularity, employability, and developer efficiency. Fastify was selected for its performance and growing ecosystem.
>**⮕ Frontend:** TypeScript was also chosen for the frontend since JavaScript is the dominant language for modern web apps. React was selected due to its popularity and strong community support.
>**⮕ Game:** The game was written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly to run natively in the browser. SDL2 was chosen for its minimalistic approach. However, this decision required us to re-implement the entire game engine, which was time-consuming.
>**⮕ Database:** A SQL database ensures strong data integrity and powerful querying capabilities. PostgreSQL was selected for its advanced open-source features, scalability, and support for complex data types.

#### Module of choice

**C++ game compiled in WebAssembly and integrated in the website**

>* **Why we chose this module:**
>We wanted to bridge the gap between high-performance native programming and the web. By choosing C++, we leverage a language known for its manual memory management and execution speed, providing a "gaming" experience with SDL2 that feels fluid and responsive, far beyond what standard DOM manipulation could offer.

>* **What technical challenges it addresses:**
>Integrating C++ into a web environment involves several complex layers:
>* Engine Architecture: We didn't just code a game; we re-implemented a lightweight game engine using SDL2, managing the game state and rendering logic manually.
>* Compilation Pipeline: Setting up Emscripten to compile C++ code into .wasm and .js glue code.
>* Memory Management: Handling the memory bridge between the JavaScript sandbox and the WebAssembly linear memory.
>* Cross-Language Communication: Implementing efficient "bindings" to allow JavaScript to trigger game events and vice versa.
>* Asset Management: Loading textures or game data within the constraints of a browser's asynchronous environment.

>* **How it adds value to your project:**
>It brings native-grade performance to the web. By bypassing the limitations of JavaScript's overhead, we provide a lag-free experience with consistent frame rates. This module proves that the project can handle computationally expensive tasks (like complex collision detection or entity management) by offloading them to a highly optimized WebAssembly binary. It demonstrates a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware, even through a browser layer.

>* **Why it deserves Major module status:**
>This isn't just a simple script; it requires a completely different development environment and toolchain compared to the rest of the stack. It solves the architectural challenge of embedding a high-performance binary within a modern web frontend without sacrificing load times or UX.

	* Multiplayer game.
	* Remote players.
	* Custom module.

* Challenges faced:
	* Game would not launch correctly on every 42 computers, because of graphics limitation.
	* Client side was missing some information from the server.
	* Sync issue between players and mobs animation and position.
	* WebSocket library use for the game server was not featuring loop tools anymore.

* Solutions:
	* Use SDL2 render-info feature to know limitation and adapt renderer and texture to the lowest performing computer.
	* Create permanent flag in client-server communication and let client side to handle some information.
	* For the client character, it needed movement prediction, and for others, it needed some smoothing (voluntary creation of a 1 frame delay).
	* Use the lambda function from us_timer_set loop from libusockets and stick it to the tool and use it as our server main event loop.
